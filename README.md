# music-classification
machine learning project for classifying composers
To set up, unzip `data.zip` so `data/composer` is in the working directory. All files are taken from https://www.midiworld.com and http://www.piano-midi.de.
To test baseline, `python baseline.py` 
To test svm, `python svm.py`
For dev mode, `-dev` flag is available for both.
To resplit data, run `python data_split.py`.
